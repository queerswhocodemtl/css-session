## Basic CSS syntax

In `index.html`, after the last comment add:

* A paragraph (`p` tag) that contains the following text: _This is a test with HTML in bold without css_ and where the word **HTML** is actually bold without css 
  * Surround the word with `b` tag
* A paragraph that contains the following text: _This is a test where there is a word in red_ and where _red_ is in red color:
  * Surround the _red_ word with a `span` tag and add a css class called `my-color`
  * Update `styles.css` file and add the proper css for this class
* A paragraph that contains the following text: _This is a test where the font color is white and the background color is red_
  * Add a class named `my-custom-class` to the paragraph
  * Update `styles.css` and add the proper css for this class
